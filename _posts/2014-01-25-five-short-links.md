I've got a few other things in the pipe-line (including part-2 of my post on [health insurance]
({% post_url 2013-11-21-private-health-insurance-opacity %})) but until then, here's 5 short links.

#### 1. Corporate culture and why projects fail

Calleam Consulting is a US project management consultancy who've been collecting a catalogue of
 IT project failures. Their [most recent post](http://calleam.com/WTPF/?p=6282) is on corporate culture, and in it
 they identify factors that detract and contribute to corporate culture:

* Negative cultures (behaviors that reduce the changes of project success):
 * Sales centric cultures (e.g. committing to anything despite the realities of resources constraints and other commitments)
 * Politically driven cultures (e.g. promoting the well connected rather than the capable)
 * A BS based culture (e.g. allowing hype and buzzwords to trump knowledge and expertise)
 * Fear driven cultures (e.g. allowing bullies to rule the roost)
 * Indifferent cultures (e.g. turning a blind eye to problems and allowing non-performance to slide)
 * Arrogance based cultures (e.g. promoting the idea that we are the best without realizing that the world is changing and ideas from outside may be better than those internally)
 * Secretive cultures (e.g. a track record of being overly secretive or having poor internal communications)

* Positive cultures (dynamics that help increase the chances of project success)
 * The culture of excellence (e.g. having high expectations of quality, knowledge and craftsmanship)
 * A customer focused culture (e.g. placing the focus on understanding the customer and working hard to meet their needs)
 * A culture of accountability (e.g. the expectations that people will own their work and take personal responsibility for it)
 * A team culture (e.g. an environment in which teamwork is valued above individual heroics)
 * Participatory cultures (e.g. an environment in which all members of staff are engaged and contributing rather than having centralized command and control)

#### 2. 51 startup failure post-mortems

[CB Insights](http://www.cbinsights.com) provides intelligence on startups (much like AngelList or CrunchBase) and they
[recently posted](http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/trends/startup-failure-post-mortem) a post-mortem of 51 startup failures.

I think this is really important because understanding why ventures aren't successful is, in itself, incredibly valuable.

#### 3. 5 questions to ask before joining a startup

The main point this [post](http://blog.expensify.com/2014/01/24/ceo-friday-5-important-questions-to-ask-before-joining-a-startup/)
is making is that before you join a company, you should interview them as much (or more) as they're
interviewing you.

For me, number 5 is very important - what do you want to acomplish and how does this move (to join the startup) help?

In my view, the best employees are those who have the skills (and desire) to successfully run their own business - that
also means they might be less likely to want to join another venture!

#### 4. Bit-twiddling

Every-so-often I stumble across a site where someone has
carefully, without fanfare, collected some very useful information.

Sean Eron Anderson's [Bit Twiddling Hacks](http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html) is one such site.

#### 5. A seriously good parody

My last link is a touch on the lighter side. Amsterdam ad agency [Flickering Wall](http://www.flickeringwall.com/) created
a slick parody of American Psycho for jeans company [Denham](http://www.denhamthejeanmaker.com/).

[No description can do it justice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpHU6TkqWjs), but a slight warning, as the end is
somewhat violent.
