#### Infonomics

The highlight of the day, for me, was [Doug Laney](http://twitter.com/doug_laney)'s presentation on the [valuation of
information](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gartnergroup/2012/05/22/infonomics-the-practice-of-information-economics/)
 (or `infonomics`).

Doug started his presentation by explaining the genesis of infonomics: in the aftermath of 9/11, and the associated
significant loss of information assets, insurers offered to pay for the replacement of the servers, but not the information
on them. In October 2001, the insurance and accounting industries in the US successfully lobbied for changes to the
accounting standards to explicitly exclude the capitalisation / valuation of information as a balance-sheet asset.

While _80% of executives_ surveyed by Gartner thought of information as an on balance sheet asset, the only information
asset that accounting standards allow on balance sheet is customer lists.

Doug also outlined a number of both economic and non-economic methodologies for valuing information assets. Tellingly,
the majority require some form of data-experimentation, also known as a `data scientist`.

#### Blunder-funding

Doug introduced the term fantastic term `blunder-funding` : organisations spending large sums after a data-breach to
prevent future losses, indirectly confirming value of the information.

#### Risk is not a direct part of the value calculation

Following a question from the audience, Doug argues that risk does not enter the value calculation, but does enter the
cost-benefit analysis for securing the information (asset).

#### A data scientist by any other name

The session before Doug's closing keynote was a panel on addressing the data skills competencies. The panel was
Gavin Keeley (FirstServis), Paul Gladigau (J.P. Morgan) and Richard Fischer (Greythorn).

Paul opened the session with the epic tale of the 11 month recruiting exercise his firm had completed to find a data
scientist. 2 months after hiring, the employee left because everyone expected him to solve their problems, absolving
them of the responsibility.

This is the best (or worst, depending on your perspective) example I have heard of the [data scientist fallacy]
(/blog/2013/02/26/the-data-scientist-fallacy/) which
I have [experienced](/blog/2012/10/20/a-sql-query-by-any-other-name/), albeit to a lesser degree.

#### Thanks Gartner

Despite [joking](https://twitter.com/xlfe/status/306267427287744512) with [Timo Elliott](https://twitter.com/timoelliott)
about wanting to be at StrataConf over Gartner, I really enjoyed the two days. It is so important for practitioners to
understand the language and thinking of executives that in many ways, I got just as much value from these two days
as I would have got from Strata, albeit of a different kind.
