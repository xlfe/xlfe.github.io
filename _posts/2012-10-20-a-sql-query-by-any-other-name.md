I recently (August 2012) had the experience of being interviewed for a "Big Data" technical role
at Suncorp.

As an aside - the job-spec mentioned a particular big data appliance - which got me thinking
about the understanding of big data. During the interview I may have said - "you know you've
got a big data problem when you can no longer assume your appliance will automatically be able
to optimize your queries".

In hindsight I was wrong there - that is not actually a problem specific to big data ;)

##### I was initially impressed by a number of things:

* the fact that the role was explicitly about big data
* the company had recently implemented a BYO device policy

It quickly emerged, however, that apparently what they were looking for was a SQL tuning expert to
convert SQL from `existing datawarehouse` to `big data appliance`.

##### In my view, this concept completely misses the potential posed by big data technology.

Aside from
my disappointment that the role was not what I had hoped for, it made me wonder about the broader
understanding of big data technology; if that was the big data strategy in a demonstrably innovative
business.

Because, when I think about big data technology, I don't see it as a replacement or enhancement of
existing business intelligence technology. I see it as a whole new way of looking at data, opening
up possibilities which are completely new.

##### but if all you've got is a hammer, then....

Has anyone else had a similar experience?
