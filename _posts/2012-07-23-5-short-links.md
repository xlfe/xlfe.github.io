I'm going to start doing '5 short links' posts, inspired by <a href="http://petewarden.typepad.com/">Pete Warden</a>'s posts of the same title.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/houseofsims/2335627386/" title="five by House Of Sims, on Flickr"><img alt="five" height="334" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2281/2335627386_17f65ae006.jpg" width="500" /></a><br />

<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/07/data-jujitsu.html">The art of turning data into product</a> discusses how simplifying problems is the key to success - I've always found DJ Patil (one of the first to popularise the term 'Data Scientist') to be insightful.<br />
<br />
Alex Rubinsteyn provides a heap of <a href="http://blog.explainmydata.com/2012/07/expensive-lessons-in-python-performance.html">great suggestions for Python performance tuning</a> (and checkout the rest of 'data data everywhere' for more ML related tips). I was especially interested to learn about <a href="http://www.picloud.com/">PiCloud</a> which simplifies running parallel / compute intensive tasks on AWS.<br />
<br />
From the Women 2.0 blog, comes a debunk of <a href="http://www.women2.com/the-8-fears-that-almost-stopped-me-from-starting-a-company/">8 fears that almost stopped me from starting a company</a>. While not all are directly relevant to me, the resounding message is powerful - don't let something being difficult stop you from attempting it!<br />
<br />
A bit out of left field, but over at Coding Horror, Jeff Atwood identifies some <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/new-programming-jargon.html">new programming jargon</a> - my favourites were the 'counterbug' and the 'common law bug'.<br />
<br />
And last, checkout <a href="http://blog.visual.ly/visual-ly-launches-social-network-for-data-visualization/">visual.ly</a> who have just launched a social network for data visualisations. Very timely, as I'm just getting into <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/">Processing</a>.<br />
