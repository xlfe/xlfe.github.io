title: The data scientist fallacy
tags:

Listening to the panel discussion on analytics and data skills [today at Gartner]
(/blog/2013/02/26/Gartner-BI-Summit-Day-2/) it occurred to me that the huge explosion in demand for
data scientists is the result of:

#### failure to adapt to change

The myth of the data scientist is the result of executives seeking a solution to the failure of their
organisations to adapt; to be agile and responsive.

#### while I call myself a data-scientist...

I'm pleased to call my self a data scientist because:

* I have a 4 year [degree in Economics](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder/bec_becon.html),
[with honours](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder/hec_hbec.html) during which time I studied advanced
econometrics, statistics as well as traditional micro-economics, behavioural economics, and game theory, plus a
host of other economics subjects. I also took electives in [advanced math]
(http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/courses/level.html#1), [philosophy and logic](http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/ug/).

* I've spent four years [working as an economist](http://www.treasury.gov.au) and performing [micro-economic research]
(http://www.pc.gov.au).

* I'm [more than handy](https://github.com/xlfe) in python and a whole other host of programming languages. I taught myself
C++ as a teenager by writing [an advanced ircbot](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dsnx).

* I've been working as a data-miner for more than two years in an internal consulting role in a large enterprise (more than
20k staff). My role involves, at times, very technical machine learning work, and more recently high-level
strategic thinking, and constant effective communication.

So, despite my dislike for the hype around the term, I embrace the concept of a `data scientist`. But,

####... if your organisational strategy revolves around the mythical concept of a jack of all trades single handedly coming in to absolve your existing executives of their responsibility to adapt to and understand information

... then I don't want to be the one to have to tell you that's not going to work.

#### You don't want a data scientist; you actually want to embrace change

Easier said than done. You could try:

* [democratizing knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization_of_knowledge) 
* [automating processes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_automation) (both for your clients or customers, and **for your staff**)
* [encouraging failure](http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html)
* [socialising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_social_networking)

#### Change is difficult to embrace

Here's two of my favourite quotes.

The first is from the inimitable Ed Yourdon and his interview with American Airlines Monte Ford in
 [CIOs at work](http://www.amazon.com/CIOs-at-Work-Ed-Yourdon/dp/1430235543)

> (imagine if your executives said) "ugh numbers, financials, budgets,...
I don't understand that budget stuff. I'll leave that up to the financial guys"
Nobody is accepting of that... but in some places it is still acceptable for somebody not to have
a thorough background and training and understanding of technology.

And of course, Paul Graham's famous quote from [Hackers and Painters](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html)

> "There is a great temptation to work on problems you can treat formally,
rather than problems that are, say, important."
