#### How unique is your date of birth?

A couple of weeks ago, a friend posted the following infographic on Facebook:
<img src="/assets/img/2013-10-29-daily-births-example.jpg">

It sparked my interest, and I went to see if I could make a similar infographic using Australian data.

My search led me to discover that while the ABS doesn't release disaggregated stats at that level, they do collect them
from the States and Territories.

I also discovered that Dr. Joshua Gans and Dr. Andrew Leigh had published
[a number](http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=Joshua+Gans+AND+Andrew+Leigh+AND+Births+-inheritance+-bargaining&btnG=&hl=en)
 of academic papers using daily births data they had obtained from the ABS.

I got in contact with Dr. Gans to see if he could release the data, but unfortunately he advised me that the terms under
which they had obtained it did not permit that.

So I went back to the ABS to find out whether I could get access to the data myself. They were very helpful, and advised
that I could get the data, but because they weren't already publishing it I would need to pay for them to extract it, on
a cost recovery basis.

I received the quote back from the ABS today, and so what better way to fund the release of this community information
than through a [crowd funding campaign](http://www.pozible.com/aussiebirths).

Please spread the word - the campaign runs for 30 days (until 28 November). If it gets funded I will release the
data on this blog (and email supporters the details).
