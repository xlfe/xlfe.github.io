### GovHack 2013

What an event. The weekend was fun and furious and I met heaps of smart & creative [hackers][1]. The [event][2] was well
organised, so a big thank you to [Pia Waugh][3] and the other GovHack volunteers.

My project, [the aps jobs gazetteer][4] is [live and online][4] and you can [checkout the other projects][5]. Prizes are announced on Thursday.
