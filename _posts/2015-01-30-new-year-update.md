### 2014

2014 was a busy year - hence the lack of updates - I delivered a couple of large projects for 
clients. I hope to be able to share more about them in the near future.

### 2015

2015 is already shaping up to be a year full of new and interesting projects/services.

I have been working on a number of projects which may turn into products. One of these is
an "Internet of Things" device I designed from scratch, assembled and wrote the 
firmware and client-side interface for.
