A few days ago [I released]({% post_url 2013-10-25-apsjobs-trends %}) more than 5 years worth of APS Gazette
unit records - data that was previously only available in PDF format, but since July this year I have been
 converting and making available on [APSindex.com](http://www.apsindex.com) and [APSjobs.info](https://www.APSjobs.info).

Today I'm releasing even more data from this rich data source:
the [full text descriptions of 5 years worth of APS Job adverts](/assets/data/apsjobs/apsjobs-5yrs-text.zip) (~18mb)

I've generated a simple word cloud below.

The top 20 words are (in decreasing order):

* officer
* manager
* assistant
* senior
* director
* employment
* project
* expected
* opportunity
* support
* analyst
* team
* executive
* service
* business
* policy
* services
* leader
* management
* finance
* technical

#### The importance of open-data

The value of [open-data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) is that it empowers citizens, helps small business,
creates value, improves the efficiency of Government and helps solve real-world problems.

This data set is an example of the Australian Public Service's commitment to transparency and accountability.
Until now, the data has been locked up in a difficult to use format; the work I've completed has added value by making
this data more accessible to citizens and business. If my work is embraced by the APS, I believe the increased
accessibility of this public data has the potential to improve efficiency and deliver further public benefits.

#### Data source

The records contained in this data set are derived from the [Australia Public Service Gazette Notices](http://www.apsjobs.gov.au).
These notices are published by the [Australian Public Service Commission](http://www.apsc.gov.au) as directed by
[The Commissioners Directions](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013L00448) under the
[Public Service Act (1999)](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A00538).

The Gazette notices are not a complete record of all engagements, movements and separations from
the Australian Public Service.

#### What is the Gazette

>    The electronic Public Service Gazette (the Gazette) contains notices required to be
    published under Chapter 2 of the Australian Public Service Commissioner's Directions
    2013 (the Directions). Notices include vacancies  and employment decisions (including
    staff movements, engagements and promotions).

>    As well as vacancies available in the APS (including Senior Executive Service, APS
    agency head and particular APS statutory office vacancies), the Gazette may contain
    vacancies and staff movements in the Australian Parliamentary Service. It may also
    contain vacancies available in non-APS Australian Government agencies.

>    The Gazette is incorporated in the APSjobs website which allows job seekers to search
    for vacancies, staff movements and other notices. APSjobs is also the electronic
    lodgement system for agencies to place notices in the Gazette.

#### Attribution

This data set is made available under a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/). You
should include the following notice in any subsequent use or publication of the full data set:

    and is derived from the APS Gazette notices published by the Australian Public
    Service Commission on the APSjobs website under a Creative Commons By
    Attribution license.

For a shorter attribution summary, something like mentioning the source as as _APSjobs data, derived from the
APS Gazette notices by pvtl_ would suffice I think.

#### Time period

These datasets refer to data [published](https://www.apsjobs.gov.au/) in the APS Employment Gazette
between 9 Aug 2007 (PS 31 2007) and 22 August 2013 (PS 33 2013) inclusive.

This comprises:

* 78,813 employment opportunities
