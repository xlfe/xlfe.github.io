I am pleased to launch [APSjobs.info](https://www.apsjobs.info) - which I've been describing
as _like Google and LinkedIn combined for the Australian Public Service_ or, as my first customer described it 
_unprecedented access to information as to who are both federal government employee and hiring decision makers_.

The site allows you to easily explore the [the last five years](/blog/2013/05/26/moreaccessablegazette/) of APS Gazette
notices, which contain both detailed job notices (including hiring managers) and appointments to those positions.

Unlike the [APSjobs.gov.au](http://www.apsjobs.gov.au) site, you can use rich and expressive search queries to find
any job listed in the last five years. Unlike the APSjobs.gov.au site, for each job listed, you can easily see who 
was appointed to the job (including their name), and, unlike the APSjobs.gov.au site, for each person, you can see 
all other jobs they have been appointed to in the last five years.

For example, here is a search for .NET related positions:

<a href="https://www.apsjobs.info" target="_blank"><img src ="/assets/img/JobSearch.png"> </a>

Clicking on the title of the job takes you to the job-details page and a list of persons appointed to the job.

<a href="https://www.apsjobs.info" target="_blank"><img src ="/assets/img/JobPage.png"> </a>

<a href="https://www.apsjobs.info" target="_blank"><img src ="/assets/img/History1.png"> </a>

Clicking on someone's name shows you their history for the last ~5-6 years. For example, here is what my 
own history page looks like:

<a href="https://www.apsjobs.info" target="_blank"><img src ="/assets/img/APSJobsSC.png"> </a>

Clicking on any of those titles takes you to the full job description including a list of other people appointed to the
position, and so on.

This is all derived from the Gazette notices. The recruitment professionals I've been talking to
have been excited to get onto the site as it gives them an unprecedented tool to find both candidates for positions 
they're hiring for, and APS hiring managers (or position contacts) who they can talk to about placing existing candidates.

I have much more to do with the site, including adding a "market intelligence" feature which will allow HR professionals to 
view APS hiring trends for the last 5 years and perform simple Analytics. I'm also planning an ad-supported website for vendors
and other parties who deal with Government to lookup public servants.

Checkout the site - it is live at [APSjobs.info](https://www.apsjobs.info) and I'd love to hear your feedback.
