'<a href="http://klabs.org/DEI/lessons_learned/aerospace_corp/scsra.pdf">How software errors contribute to satellite failures</a>' catalogues a number of complete losses of satellites due to engineering / software failure. I found the slide deck fascinating because I always thought of space engineering (ie NASA and others) as setting the bar well above that of other engineering projects. The fact that even these projects, where failure is a complete write off (although satellite failure typically doesn't involve loss of life) are subject to the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemantics">complexity problems</a> as civilian engineering projects strengthens the argument of simplicity and acceptance of component failure as inevitable.<br/>

'<a href="http://architects.dzone.com/articles/graph-theor-and-network?mz=111665-bigdata">Graph theory and network science : the basics</a>' is a nice (and brief) introduction. Graph theory (and network analysis) is one of my areas of research interest. Please <a href="http://twitter.com/xlfe">drop me a line</a> if it's one of yours :)<br/>

<a href="http://blog.jelastic.com/2012/08/13/hate-java/">Over at Code Mechanic</a>,  Jonathan Fisher starts a flame war about Java versus 'less hated languages' - but his actual point is that the real battle shouldn't be Java vs ?? but (for example) COBOL vs any language developed in the last 15 years. He makes an particularly interesting point about Mainframe pricing - that it is based on CPU cycles - that's like getting in a taxi where you're charged by how much the engine revs - the incentives for the driver (the system designer) might not be particularly well aligned with your own...<br/>

Over on the <a href="http://eng.pulse.me/backend-tips-the-free-cdn/">pulse engineering blog</a>, Greg Bayer details how to setup the files hosted within Google App Engine to work with Google's Edge CDN - for free! A truly awesome hack if you ask me :)<br/>
<br>
Finally, <a href="http://www.udemy.com/lean-startup-sxsw-2012-videos-and-presentations/">Udemy is hosting</a> Eric Ries' Lean Startup course from SXSWi 2012. Awesome! (Now I just need to watch them!)<br/>
