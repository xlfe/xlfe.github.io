Here's the details of two Australian Startup Incubators closing in November. If I've missed any, please [let me know]
(http://twitter.com/xlfe) and I'll add them below.

### [Startmate](http://www.startmate.com.au/)

See [Blackbird Ventures](http://www.blackbird.vc)

* Applications close `24 Nov 2013`
* Funding terms `$50k, 7.5%`
* Length `5 months`
* Location `Sydney`

### [Muru-D](https://muru-d.com/)

Muru-D is Telstra's newly launched startup incubator.

* Applications close `25 Nov 2013`
* Funding terms `$40k, 6%`
* Length `6 months`
* Location `Sydney`

#### Others

There are a heap of other Australian startup incubators, but none I could find which had applications open (or closing soon)
and that weren't restricted (for example, Sydney Uni has [Incubate](http://incubate.org.au/incubator/) which closes
in early November, but you must be a 
member or alumni of Sydney Uni).
