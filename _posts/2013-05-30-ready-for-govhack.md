#### A sprint before the start

I've spent the last 3 weeks (after hours) working [on a parser](/blog/2013/05/26/moreaccessablegazette/) for the
[APS Gazette](http://www.apsjobs.gov.au).

I have been relatively successful, and I now have a very interesting data set based on Open Government data
to use for [GovHack 2013](http://www.govhack.org).

The rule of thumb with any data science project is that 80% of the time is spent cleaning and preparing the data, while
the remaining 20% of the time is spent on the more interesting bit. Unfortunately I think that holds true for this work
as well.

I'm really looking forward to building something cool and useful for GovHack - I have one idea in particular which I'm
very excited about.

I plan also, time permitting, to post more detailed analysis of the trends and insights from the data and I hope to answer
some of the questions [raised previously](/blog/2013/05/26/moreaccessablegazette/).

Wish me luck!
