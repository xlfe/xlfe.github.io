#### Scratching an itch

So for a while now, I've wanted an easy way to store stuff directly in my Google Drive, but I don't have access
to GDrive from all of my email accounts.

I was suprised to discover that there's no easy way to email an attachment straight into your Drive. Of course
you can email it to you gmail account and then when you're able to login to GMail save it to your drive. But that
seemed to be abit 2010 for me.

#### If you build it

So I'm proud to introduce [drv.io](http://drv.io) - the lost feature - a very simple service to email files straight
into your Google Drive.

Enjoy!
