The Australian Government [declared](http://www.finance.gov.au/blog/2013/05/22/australia-joins-open-government-partnership/)
its support for Open Government in May 2013:

> The Australian Government now declares that, in order to promote greater participation in Australia’s
democracy, it is committed to open government based on a culture of engagement, built on **better access to
and use of government held information, and sustained by the innovative use of technology**.

> Citizen collaboration in policy and service delivery design will enhance the processes of government and improve the
outcomes sought. **Collaboration with citizens is to be enabled and encouraged**. Agencies are to reduce **barriers to online
engagement**, undertake social networking, **crowd sourcing and online collaboration projects** and support online engagement
by employees, in accordance with the Australian Public Service Commission Guidelines.

The value of these Open Government principles is one of simple economics: contestable and transparent markets are typically
more efficient than those operating under conditions of monopoly. Public policy is no different. The best ideas are those
that survive scrutiny and analysis. Governments have typically held a monopoly on providing public policy advice because
they control access to many of the resources required to formulate that advice.

The most significant of these resources is information that feeds into public policy making. This is why the concept
of Open Government [relies](http://ands.org.au/resource/cost-benefit.html) on **better access to the use of government held information**.

While the declaration is a necessary step for the Australian Government to embrace increased efficiency in public policy
formulation and delivery, it is far from sufficient.

Albeit that it is still early days, **there is significant resistance to enabling contestability and public
collaboration on public policy in some parts of the Australian Public Service**.

This article details one such example in depth.

### The [Private Health Insurance Ombudsman](ttp://www.phio.gov.au) (PHIO)

The PHIO is a Commonwealth Government Statutory Agency established in 2007 under the *Private Health Insurance Act 2007*.

Its stated aims, under the Act, [include](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00360/Html/Text#_Toc361402630)
**disseminating information about private health insurance** and the rights and obligations of privately insured people.

That sounds pretty good - we've got a Government body who's funded to provide information about private health insurance.

Unfortunately, my experience in dealing with the PHIO has been quite the opposite.

### How easy is it to compare Private Health Insurance Policies?

The PHIO breathlessly [claims](http://www.phio.org.au/downloads/file/PublicationItems/PHIOAnnualReport2013.pdf) that:

> The consumer website PrivateHealth.gov.au is Australia’s leading source of independent information about health
insurance for consumers.

**Unfortunately, there is no basis for their claim**, and data shows it to be patently false.

We can examine their claim by comparing the [PHIO run website](http://www.privatehealth.gov.au) with other Australian
Private Health Insurance Comparison Websites using data from [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com) (the Web Information Company):

<img src="/assets/img/health-opacity/health-traffic-metrics.png">

The data shows that, in Australia, the PHIO site is ranked 5th out of these sites. Not exactly what I'd call *the leading
source*. Infact, the other sites on the list received 460% more page views than the PHIO run site.

But let's give the PHIO the benefit of the doubt. What if it is just the case that not many people know about the PHIO
run website? What if those people that make it to the PHIO run website actually find it much more useful?

Alexa provides the following figures to test that hypothesis:

<img src="/assets/img/health-opacity/health-engagement-metrics.png">

These engagements metrics are actually even more damning: they show that the PHIO run site has the highest
[bounce rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate) out of all of the listed sites; that is, **two thirds of visitors
to the PHIO run Private Health Comparison site leave immediately**.

I was one of those who found their site to be pretty uninspiring when I tried to use it a few years ago. I forgot about that,
however, until recently a colleague reminded me how difficult it was to actually **compare health policies** using
[the site](http://www.privatehealth.gov.au).

Her experience was one of frustration. In order to compare more than a few policies at a time, she had to click through
multiple pages (each very slow to load) and try to remember what previous pages had said. If she wanted
more details she had to download a PDFs for *every policy she was interested in* and then try and switch back and
forth between each to make a comparison. What a joke!

It's no surprise to me that the PHIO run site is not particularly popular in comparison to the other sites, which use
modern interfaces and actually allow you to compare policies in a quick and easy manner.

Infact this appears to be a pretty clear example of the wasteful Government provision of services which are already provided by
the private sector. That's not to say the PHIO doesn't perform other important functions which are not performed by the
private sector (for example, dispute resolution and complaints handling). It just that the PHIO clearly does not have the
advantage in providing a useful comparison website to consumers.

So given all that, [I decided to compile a spreadsheet of all available Private Health Insurance Policies in Australia]
(/blog/2013/09/23/private-health-insurance/). I was surprised that there were more than 43,000 policies available or
previously available for sale.

My collegue and others were very pleased to be able to access a simple spreadsheet of policies which they could then
examine as they saw fit.

Infact, even one of the health insurers provided encouragement:

<img src="/assets/img/health-opacity/bupa-tweet.png">

So you might imagine my surprise upon receiving the following email from
the PHIO Media Office:

<img src="/assets/img/health-opacity/PHIO-email1.png">

At first they assert that the information is subject to [Commonwealth Copyright](http://www.ag.gov.au/cca) provisions,
implying that I needed to seek permission from the Commonwealth to publish the data.

This is actually wrong - Attorney-Generals Department advises that:

>Australian Government agencies are required to release copyright public sector information under Creative Commons by
licence or other open content licences, wherever possible.

>An agency's copyright notice can usually be found at the front or back of a published document, or through a link
at the very bottom of its web pages. Contact the relevant agency's copyright section directly if a copyright notice
still refers to the CCA or requires further permission for use of the material.

(View a screenshot of AGs' advice [earlier this year](/assets/img/health-opacity/AGCCA-15-May-2013.png)).

They then go on to suggest that I should not publish the data because the data is **owned** by the insurers, and that I
would need to seek permission from the insurers to publish the information.

So in two short paragraphs they completely contradict themselves. Either the Commonwealth holds copyright on the content
and therefore it is available under a Creative Commons license, or they have published the information without reference
to the fact that it is subject to a third-party claim of copyright.

In either case, they have completely misunderstood what copyright protects. If they had bothered to have a look at AGs [helpful guide]
(http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/Documents/ShortGuidetoCopyright-October2012.pdf), they would have noted in the
first paragraph of the document:

> Copyright protects the form or way an idea or information is expressed, **not the idea or information itself**.

While their expression of the data would be covered by copyright (ie, their actual HTML pages and site layout), that is
not what I was republishing. I had [published](/blog/2013/09/23/private-health-insurance/) just the underlying
database - devoid of any creative expression.

It  seems pretty clear to me that the information itself is not subject to copyright.

My response:

<img src="/assets/img/health-opacity/PHIO-email2.png">

Unfortunately their response makes the same assertion again, and they go even further:

<img src="/assets/img/health-opacity/PHIO-email3.png">

In my view, the last two sentences in the PHIO's response are the most telling:

>It is important to acknowledge, however, that insurers consider this data to be valuable commercial information. The
ability for their competitors to access the data in a form that allows them to more easily manipulate and analyse it
is of concern to insurers.

The PHIO again asserts that I need to seek permission from the insurers to publish their policy coverage and pricing data
 because of their concerns **about the ease of manipulation and analysis of the insurers' policy coverage and pricing**.

So the PHIO, which is a publicly funded body, tasked with (from their Act) **disseminating information about private
health insurance** appears to be attempting to enforce the (non-existent!) copyright of third-parties (the insurers)
to restrict the ease of which consumers can actually compare and contrast Private Health Insurance policies.

**What the?!**

Now, by this stage I wasn't sure how to proceed. So I reached out to a few people for advice.

If you, dear reader, are wondering where you can go for advice on Copyright and Government and Open Government, then
please read on.

### Copyright, Gov 2.0 and the Australian Government

While the Attorney-Generals Department was historically responsible for administration of Commonwealth Copyright, they
[no longer](http://www.ag.gov.au/cca) manage it, and advise that *each agency is responsible for the management of
its own copyright licenses*.

So at the very top level, we have the Government declaring its commitment to Open Government, and AGs declaring that
*Australian Government agencies are required to release copyright public sector information under Creative Commons by
licence or other open content licences, wherever possible* but then each agency is responsible for implementing
their own management of that policy.

I received a few suggestions that the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner](http://www.OAIC.gov.au) might
be able to offer advice on the use of the PHIO published information. I did contact them, and their initial advice was
that unless my question related to the Privacy Act or Freedom of Information Act, they were unable to assist.
After a [discussion on twitter](https://twitter.com/xlfe/status/393257670104199168) however, they provided the following
advice:

>Although the OAIC supports the greater release of public sector information, and encourages agencies to follow the
Principles on open public sector information by making more information available under open licensing conditions, we have
no jurisdiction over decisions of individual agencies about their copyright policies.

>You may be interested in some of the concerns expressed by the Information Commissioner about current whole-of-government
copyright arrangements in the February 2013 report, [Open public sector information: from principles to practice]
(http://www.oaic.gov.au/information-policy/information-policy-resources/information-policy-reports/open-public-sector-information-from-principles-to-practice).

The report makes for very interesting reading (I have just asked the OAIC whether the underlying survey data is available).

Unfortunately, the overall implementation of this policy appears to be pretty haphazard; a simple comparison of the ratio of
Australian Government sites [without a Creative Commons license]
(https://www.google.com.au/search?q=site%3Agov.au+-%22Creative+Commons%22+Copyright) to [those with]
(https://www.google.com.au/search?q=site%3Agov.au+%22Creative+Commons%22+Copyright) shows a ratio of about 100:1.

There is one fantastic resource available to Government in this space - the [Australian Governments Open Access and
Licensing](http://www.AusGOAL.gov.au) Framework.

As an Economist, Open Government advocate and data-scientist, I feel very strongly that publicly available information
should be open to remixing and reuse. I guess I'm also pretty stubborn because on matters of principle I don't shy away
from pursing a progressive outcome.

So in Part II of this saga I'll detail the steps I've taken to try to get the PHIO to resolve their internal
contradiction on the data they publish. If you thought Part I was interesting, wait until you read the correspondence
in Part II :)
